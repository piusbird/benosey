# BeNosey

Scrapes the BeOs/Haiku clipboard for text data. Written As the first step,
in a long running project to port/build a screen reader for HaikuOS.
Most of that work is still a crashy mess of incomprehensible mush.
I'm still learning beos api with vision impairments.

This is the one thing that actually works, so i thought hey lets release it.

Enjoy
